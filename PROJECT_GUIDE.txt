# Example URLS for Actual Speeches and Remarks:

http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/30/remarks-first-lady-grassroots-campaign-event-democratic-candidate-govern

http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/24/remarks-first-lady-children-norad-santa-tracker-calls

http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/26/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-commencement-ceremony-united-states-mil

## Problem: each URL is unique and follows no pattern save the initial string "http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office" 



Parent URL Example:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/Speeches-and-Remarks/2012/05?page=0
http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/Speeches-and-Remarks/2012/05?page=1
http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/Speeches-and-Remarks/2012/05?page=2


These parent URLs have links for each speech.

Example 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/31/remarks-president-obama-first-lady-michelle-obama-former-president-georg



## Need to first scrape the range of page numbers. If you put in a ?page=<# that is invalid>, the page returns to the first page and you will rescrape data you already have.


Page number ref's seem to be embedded in this bit of HTML
<div class="item-list">

    <ul class="pager"></ul>

</div>




##### BASIC URL STRATEGY #####

#1 FIRST
	Generate a list of all parent directories at
	http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/Speeches-and-Remarks/YYYY/MM

	where YYYY/MM begins at 2009/01 and ends at the present year and month combination



#2 SECOND
	For a given year month combination, scape/count how many categories of HTML code exist for "<li class="pager-item">"
	The total number of pages is indexed at 0 and goes to the number of <li class="pager-item"> elements. If there are 4, then their are 1+4 pages ranging page=0 to page=4


#3 THIRD
	Use the scraped (page 0 to X for each YYYY/MM combination) information to create a list of all parent URLS. Make this a new list.



#4 FOURTH

	For all links in the parent URL list, scape all page links for the speeches and remarks: 
	<div class="view-content">
		all <a href=> links

	Export all parent URL's to a list.


#5 FIFTH

	For each URL in the Speechs URL list:

		Return a list of all URL's and save. 


# AFTER
	Run each URL through text scraper function
	Scrape the date/time and collect as a new var function
	Save each text output to a txt file <name=date_time>
